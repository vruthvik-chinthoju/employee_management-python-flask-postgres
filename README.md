# Employee-Management Flask Application

## One-Line Summary
A Flask web application demonstrating backend development with Python, clean architecture, and real-world project practices.

---

## Project Title
Employee-Management Application

---

## Overview
The Employee-Management Flask Application is a backend-focused web project built using Flask and Python. It demonstrates how a real-world web application is structured by separating backend logic, templates, and static assets. The project follows clean coding practices and is suitable for showcasing backend and full-stack fundamentals to recruiters.

---

## Problem Statement
Many beginner projects lack proper structure, scalability, and real-world relevance. This project addresses that gap by implementing a well-organized Flask application that reflects industry-style backend development and clean project architecture.

---

## Dataset
This project does not use an external dataset.  
All data handling is managed internally through application logic.  
The project can be easily extended to support databases such as SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
